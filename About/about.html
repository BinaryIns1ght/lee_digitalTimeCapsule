                Welcome to my About Me page... 
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Donovan S. Lee. I am currently a 
                22-year-old Korean-American, living in 
                California. I used to live within the Bay Area. 
                With the recent moving, I now live within the 
                outskirts of the Bay Area. I am currently a 
                Visual Communication Design major.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently seek to improve upon my current 
                designing skills. Despite my few experiences in 
                designing, I am a long way from finally making 
                my designs stand out drastically and even 
                possibly add on to the pre-existing aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
                I fall in the line of Generation Z, yet the many 
                things I've enjoyed are nowadays often considered 
                as "old-fashioned" or antique. The many items/media 
                I love are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Old Games, like "<em id="smb">Super Mario Brothers</em>", or "<em id="sth">Sonic The Hedgehog</em>"</li>
                <li>"<em id="ht">Happy Together</em>" by the Turtles</li>
                <li>"<em id="ib">I'm Blue</em>" by Eiffel 65</li>
                <li>Frutiger Aero aesthetic</li>
                <li>Frutiger Aurora aesthetic</li>
            </ul>
