                    This photo is taken place in the Grand 
                    Canyon. As you can see the physical 
                    appearance of the pillars, you can see 
                    the layers of the different aspects of 
                    the sediment there.

                    A photo of a large canyon found, as 
                    my family's car passes over an 
                    unassuming bridge. This was taken due
                    to the unexpected beautiful view of 
                    this ravine/canyon.

                    "Great American Eclispe", or the 
                    solar eclipse of 2017. This was taken 
                    with the eclipse glasses over the 
                    iPhone's camera lenses.

                    An old photo of myself back in my high 
                    school years. More specifically, hours 
                    before my graduation from the high school.
                    Looking at this photo make me realzie how 
                    much time has already passed.

                    This is a unique photo showing the sun
                    shining through the clouds. I thought this 
                    is pretty in ways on how it can symbolize 
                    light can shine through the darkness.

                    This a photo of a view nearby Half Moon Bay,
                    California. This is taken place on my journey
                    from my university to my home [I live outside 
                    of the campus].

                    This another photo of the same site as the entry 
                    before, but I also like this photo as well, mostly 
                    due to the appearance with the Sun shining brightly 
                    above the thick, dark fog below.
