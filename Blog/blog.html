                    This photo is taken place in the Grand 
                    Canyon. As you can see the physical 
                    appearance of the pillars, you can see 
                    the layers of the different aspects of 
                    the sediment there.

                    my family's car passes over an 
                    unassuming bridge. This was taken due
                    to the unexpected beautiful view of 
                    this ravine/canyon.

                    An old photo of myself back in my high 
                    school years. More specifically, hours 
                    before my graduation from the high school.
                    Looking at this photo make me realzie how 
                    much time has already passed.

                    This is a unique photo showing the sun
                    shining through the clouds. I thought this 
                    is pretty in ways on how it can symbolize 
                    light can shine through the darkness.

                    This is where I began experimenting with color and 
                    typefaces. Admittingly, it doesn't look too good, 
                    but does help me practice on what effect the typefaces 
                    have.

                    This a photo of a view nearby Half Moon Bay,
                    California. This is taken place on my journey
                    from my university to my home [I live outside

                    This is a photo of a carnival the car I usually come 
                    home with. There's this carnival that opens during the 
                    fall, and at night, there's these bright lights that 
                    gleams in the darkness, catching my attention.
