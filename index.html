                My name is Donovan Seung-Ho Lee. I am
                currently a student studying Visual 
                Communication Design. Even with some 
                experiences in designing, I am from a 
                long way from truly findng a way to truly 
                make a good design.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The idea of beauty of design is always 
                considered as subjective, but I must need 
                more experiences to truly master designing.
                I am a long way from making real designs for 
                people. Hopefully, with more experiences, I 
                can eventually master the many pre-existing 
                aesthetics and even maybe, create a new one.

            <p>
                It's kind of hard to consider what is 
                good design for many people. Many see 
                pieces with a deeper meaning behind 
                it is a good design. Some see visually
                pleasing pieces and see those as good
                designs.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For me, I see good design is where 
                someone is willing to put in good effort
                in making the piece and has some creative
                element to it. Some pieces may be incredibly 
                beautiful, while others can have a more 
                Avante Garde to their designs. It's quite a 
                difficult thing to claim something as well 
                designed. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some pieces have a tone of anger, stress, or 
                gloom. Another can have a sense of optimism, 
                glee, and bubbly. What is considered as good 
                design to be is a design that has a good 
                amount of effort put onto it and allows the 
                viewer to understand and explore the piece.
