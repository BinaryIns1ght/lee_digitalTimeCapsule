                My name is 
                <em>Donovan S. Lee</em>. I am
                currently a student studying Visual 
                Communication Design. Even with some 
                experiences in designing, I am a 
                long way from truly finding a way to truly 
                make a good design. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="body">
                The idea of beauty of design is always 
                considered as subjective, but I must need 
                more experiences to truly master designing.
                I am a long way from making real designs for 
                people. Hopefully, with more experiences, I 
                can eventually master the many pre-existing 
                aesthetics and even maybe, create a new one.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
                Currently, not too experienced in designing. 
                I still need a lot more experience on improving 
                my craft and further craft my own style and way 
                of interpreting designs. I make sure my designs 
                are well-crafted and thought-out, though, 
                admittingly, I have had some designs that don't 
                get the message through thoroughly.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
                Many aesthetics I saw range from incredibly 
                retro to modernized. Some have a sense of 
                nostalgia and some adapt as technology advances. 
                Iâ€™ve seen these stylistic designs and always 
                wondered how to recreate these aesthetics, while 
                recreating this in my own style.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
                In this site, you can know more about me and 
                see more updates on my life. For many that 
                are curious, you can also see more updates 
                to the site as well, as I improve upon my 
                skills. 
            </p>
            <p class="body">
                Here, we explore my past and current works as 
                a designer and various other information about 
                myself. From my photography and gifs I've made, 
                to the few designs I've created, you can see some 
                ideas on what type of design style I currently have, 
                and maybe have some way of evolving my style to 
                adapt as time changes.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
                I am still learning new lessons on how to improve 
                upon my craft, and hopefully, later on, get an 
                idea on how to improve on what to do as a designer. 
                Can probably replicate an aesthetic my own way, 
                having it stand out, while allowing the viewer to 
                get the message as soon as possible when shown.
