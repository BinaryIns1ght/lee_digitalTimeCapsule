                My name is Donovan Seung-Ho Lee. I am
                currently a student studying Visual 
                Communication Design. Even with some 
                experiences in designing, I am from a 
                long way from truly findng a way to truly 
                make a good design.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of beauty of design is always 
                considered as subjective, but I must need 
                more experiences to truly master designing.
